# Instructions for running the tests

## ProGen2

To install the original ProGen2, clone the repository and move the `progen2` directory to this tests directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salesforce/progen
mv progen/progen2 ./
rm -rf progen
```

with the progen2 directory in the tests directory, you can run the tests involving ProGen2 in `benchmark_faprogen2.py`.
